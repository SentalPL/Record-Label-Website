***
This application is my first MVC project. I was programming in
procedural style for 2 years, so OOP was hard to me to understand
in practice. Code in "classes" folder comes from internet tutorial. 

During work I choose wrong models or classes as a place for
few functions. Today I want to change OOP structure, but I'll keep this
as it is until implement second version of this website.
Few of functions, which You probably will look for are in
ProvenUsefulFunctions or Model (classes folder).

Through making this website I have learned a lot of things about 
actions on files and folders, MVC structure, RWD and Bootstrap 
(but I hate front-end..).
